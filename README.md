# Out-of-distribution detection through network activations

This project builds on the paper [Energy-based Out-of-distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03759) (integrated submodule references the official github repo of the paper). Instead of using the denominator of the softmax layer, here activations of the entire network are used.
